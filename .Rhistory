# Wow!  It looks like setosa has different Petal dimensions!
# Well, at least according to the mean values.  Wouldn't it be
# nice if we could just see the points and see if anything pops?
# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# We can see the points!  Here we plot it!

# Good grief!  Not only did the setosas look really different, but it looks like
# you can distinguish between the versicolors and virginicas too!
#
# We should look at some pictures and see if this makes sense:
#
# Here's a picture of a setosa: https://images.app.goo.gl/LdheUNmY4HkJheco7
# Here's a picture of a versicolor: https://images.app.goo.gl/SiHB9WBHpo1J3w1v6
# Here's a picture of a virginica: https://images.app.goo.gl/X4LCa5TGxaujvUJK9

# It's... obvious?
